Very simple ... sort of.

function alloc(balls, boxes):

    if boxes = 1
        return [balls]
    else
       for n in range 0:balls
           return alloc(balls-n, boxes-1)

That's the basic recursion logic: pick each possible quantity of balls, then recur on the remaining balls and one box fewer.
